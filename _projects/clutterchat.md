A Twitter-inspired social platform that combines the robustness of Ruby on Rails with real-time capabilities of Node.js. The application uses Rails for the main application logic, user management, and data persistence, while a separate Node.js server handles real-time messaging through WebSockets. Redis is used for session management and real-time data caching.

## Features

* Ruby on Rails backend for core application functionality
* Node.js WebSocket server for real-time messaging
* PostgreSQL database for data persistence
* Redis for session management and caching
* Real-time notifications and message delivery
* User authentication and authorization
* Tweet-like post creation and interaction via discord oauth
* Real-time feed updates
