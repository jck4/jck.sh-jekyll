A Python-based tool that helps Path of Exile players manage their inventory through mathematical calculations and API integration. The project uses the official Path of Exile API to fetch item data and PyQt for creating an overlay interface. It calculates item positions and properties using mathematical formulas to determine optimal organization strategies.

## Features

* Real-time item tracking using mathematical position calculations
* Custom PyQt overlay interface that integrates with the game window
* Path of Exile API integration for item data and properties
* Automated item categorization based on API data
* Smart stash tab suggestions based on item rarity and type
* Configurable hotkeys for quick item management
* Support for custom item filters and rules
